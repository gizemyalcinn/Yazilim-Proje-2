# Program Learning Outcomes and Evaluation Matrix Project

## Overview

This project involves generating tables and calculations to evaluate the success rates of students in relation to course learning outcomes and program learning outcomes. The project uses given data to create structured matrices and success metrics, following a detailed set of evaluation criteria.

## Deliverables

The following deliverables are expected from this project:
1. **Tables for Evaluation:**
   - Course Learning Outcomes vs. Program Learning Outcomes Matrix
   - Course Learning Outcomes vs. Evaluation Criteria Matrix
   - Weighted Evaluation Table
   - Success Rates Table for Course Learning Outcomes
   - Success Rates Table for Program Learning Outcomes

2. **Bonus Feature:**
   - A web crawler implementation (optional).

3. **Documentation:**
   - A detailed project report explaining the methods and results.

## Project Instructions

1. **Course and Program Outcomes:**
   - Define course learning outcomes as string values.
   - Create matrices that show relationships between program and course outcomes.

2. **Evaluation Criteria:**
   - Minimum of three criteria (e.g., Homework, Midterm, Final).
   - Define weights for each criterion (total must not exceed 100%).

3. **Student Grades:**
   - Create a table of student grades for the evaluation criteria.
   - Ensure all grades are between 0 and 100.

4. **Matrices and Calculations:**
   - Generate matrices for relationships between outcomes and evaluation criteria.
   - Calculate weighted evaluation scores and success percentages.
     
5. **Success Tables**:

For each student, calculate success rates for both course and program learning outcomes.
